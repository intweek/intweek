Hey there👋
Call me **intweek**! I am a 16 year old male (he/him) student from a small country in Europe called Lithuania. Doing programming mainly for fun, the programming that is taught in my school is so basic that I can't do anything with it. **Love to solve real-life problems**, not just arbritrary projects with usseless problems that don't exist and are created for the soul purpose to solve them.
