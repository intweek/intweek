Hey thereðŸ‘‹\n
âž¤Call me **intweek**!\n
âž¤I am a 16 year old male (he/him) student from a small country in Europe called Lithuania.\n
âž¤Doing programming mainly for fun, the programming that is taught in my school is so basic that I can't do anything with it.\n
âž¤**Love to solve real-life problems**, not just arbritrary projects with usseless problems that don't exist and are created for the soul purpose to solve them.\n
âž¤Currently working with **C++** (which is my first learned language btw), on _Visual Studio code_.
